## Introduction

This dataset includes all Florida Legislature bills from 1998-2023 with info on
authors, co-sponsors, vote history, and bill summaries. Each record also has a
link to the full bill text (where available). Each vote record has a link to the
roll call for the vote. (Vote information could be further mined to create legislative 
report cards.)

The significance of this dataset lies in its potential to facilitate a deeper understanding of legislative dynamics in Florida. We believe this information will be particularly useful for students and researchers in political science, enabling them to conduct robust analyses and draw meaningful conclusions about the evolution of policy-making in Florida. Furthermore, by making this dataset publicly available, we hope to contribute to a more informed dialogue among citizens, scholars, and policymakers about the future governance of Florida.

In essence, our goal in publishing this dataset is to support academic research and civic engagement. We envision that the insights gleaned from this data will not only advance scholarly understanding but also aid in the decision-making processes of leaders and citizens, ultimately contributing to the betterment of the state of Florida.

## Source
The bill information was pulled from the Florida legislative website for both
the House and Senate, located at https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bills/

## Exploring Further

You can explore the data further and create plots. Let's take a look a few examples.

### Bills Filed Per Year
A straightforward plot to begin with is a the number of bills filed in the 15-year 
period from 2005 and 2020. (Note: The minimum point on the graph is around 1800 
bills filed in the years 2015 and 2016.)

```{r billsByYear, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

data(bills)

bills_summary <- bills %>%
  filter(Year >= 2005 & Year <= 2020 ) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(bills_summary, aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Total, colour = "Total"), size=1.25) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Bills") +
  ggtitle("Number of Bills per Year")
```

### Veto Actions Per Year
Let's take a look at the number of veto actions across all years in the dataset, and adding some smoothing to the graph.

```{r vetoActionsByYear, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

data(actions)

bills_veto_summary <- actions %>%
  filter( str_detect(Action, 'Veto')) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Total = n())

ggplot(bills_veto_summary, aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Total, colour = "Total"), span=0.2,, se=FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Bills") +
  ggtitle("Number of Veto Actions")
```

### Proposed Appropriations by Year
Appropriation bills (excluding claims) for the entire period, total amount per year"
```{r appropriationsByYear, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)  # For label_number()

# Summarize the data
yearly_totals <- appropriations %>%
  filter(Claim == FALSE) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(TotalAmount = sum(Amount, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the data

# Proposed Appropriations by Year
ggplot(yearly_totals, aes(x = Year, y = TotalAmount)) +
  #  geom_line() +  # Creates the line plot
  geom_point(shape = 1, color = "green", size = 3, fill = NA) +  # Small, blue, unfilled circles
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2, se = FALSE, color = "green") +  # Adds a smoothed line
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = " B", prefix = "$", scale = 1e-9)) + # millions
  labs(title = "Proposed Appropriations by Year", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Appropriations") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Top Bill Authors From 2010 to 2015
For the period of 2010 through 2015, the top bill authors were:
```{r topBillAuthors5Year, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

data(authors)

filtered_authors <- authors %>%
  filter(Year >= 2005, Year <= 2010) %>%
  group_by(Author, Year) %>%
  summarise(TotalBills = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Finding the top 5 authors
top_authors <- filtered_authors %>%
  group_by(Author) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(TotalBills), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  top_n(5, Total) %>%
  select(Author)

# Filtering the data for only top authors
top_authors_data <- filtered_authors %>%
  filter(Author %in% top_authors$Author)

# Plotting the data
ggplot(top_authors_data, aes(x = Year, y = TotalBills, group = Author, color = Author)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span=0.4, se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Bill Authors (2010-2015)",
       x = "Year", y = "Total Bills Authored") +
  theme_minimal()

```


### Bills by Various Topics of Interest
Perhaps your research is concerned with drugs (legal or otherwise) and law 
enforcement. A simple full-text search of the bill summaries for keywords of
interest could be a good starting point.

```
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

data(bills)

topics <- c("law enforcement", "marijuana", "drugs")

# Create a function to determine the topic based on summary
find_topic <- function(summary) {
  for (topic in topics) {
    if (str_detect(summary, regex(topic, ignore_case = TRUE))) {
      return(topic)
    }
  }
  return(NA)
}

# Create the new dataframe with the additional Topic column
bill_topics <- bills %>%
  mutate(Topic = sapply(Summary, find_topic)) %>%
  na.omit()

# Group by Year and Topic, then count
year_topic_count <- bill_topics %>%
  group_by(Year, Topic) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Plotting the data
ggplot(year_topic_count, aes(x = Year, y = Count, group = Topic, color = Topic)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span=0.4, se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Count by Year for Each Topic",
       x = "Year", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Wordcloud Visualiztions
Simple visualizations are often the most powerful communicators. Let's take a look
at all the bill filers for the the year 2022 and put them into a wordcloud.


```
library(dplyr)
library(wordcloud2)
library(stringr)

data(bills)

# Summarize the data to get the frequency of each category
filer_freq <- bills %>%
  filter(Year == 2022) %>%
  select(FiledBy) %>%
  group_by(FiledBy) %>%
  summarise(Frequency = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(Frequency > 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(Frequency))

# Using wordcloud2 to create the word cloud
wordcloud2(filer_freq)
```

![ ](images/wordcloud-filedby-2022.png)

The possibilities are endless. The following wordcloud is a representation of the frequency of bill filers (filed_by) who filed local government preemptions between 2010 and 2022, as identified by the Florida League of Cities researchers (preemptions), along with topic frequencies pulled from bill titles (bills) (using tidytext to filter out stop words). The frequency of filers was scaled compared to topics to aid in visualization.

## Next Steps
By examining the comprehensive details of legislative bills from 1998 to 2023, including authors, filers, co-introducers, legislative actions, and voting results, scholars can gain deep insights into the workings of the Florida legislature. Additionally, the data from the Florida League of Cities adds a unique dimension by highlighting instances where state legislation has overridden local government autonomy.

This dataset is not just a historical record; it's a laboratory for testing theories and models in political science. For example, researchers can explore the impact of political affiliation on legislative success. By comparing the success rate of bills authored by different parties, insights can be gained into partisan dynamics within the legislature. Additionally, by analyzing the full bill summaries and vote results, one could investigate the role of legislative framing and rhetoric in securing votes. This could involve using natural language processing techniques to identify which phrases or styles correlate with successful legislation.

Moreover, the dataset provides opportunities to delve into the nuances of policy areas. Researchers might examine trends in environmental, educational, or health-related bills, providing a window into how priorities have shifted over time. They can also explore the relationship between lobbyists and legislation, by linking bill subjects with lobbying activities. Furthermore, advanced statistical analysis could reveal hidden patterns in legislative activity, such as identifying periods of high legislative productivity or stagnation.

Additional research ideas could include:

* Analyzing the effect of external events (like natural disasters or economic recessions) on the types of bills introduced and passed.
* Investigating the role of demographics in legislative success: Are bills introduced by women or minority legislators more or less likely to pass? How about bills from rural vs urban/suburban districts? Freshman vs senior legislators?
* Studying amendments to bills: What types of amendments are most common, and how do they affect a bill’s likelihood of passage?
* Correlating electoral cycles with legislative activity: Is there a noticeable change in the types of bills filed or passed in election years?
* Using sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion on certain bills, possibly linking it with social media data.

Most importantly, the results of this research, and this and other datasets, can be used to produce effective visualizations to better communicate the traditionally complex world of politics simply and effectively to voters. 

By engaging with this dataset, political science students and researchers can not only contribute to the academic understanding of legislative processes but also potentially influence future policymaking through their findings. The possibilities for discovery and impact are vast, making this dataset an invaluable resource for those seeking to delve deeper into the world of political science and data analytics.
